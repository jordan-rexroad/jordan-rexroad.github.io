React-TodoList

Description

My name is Jordan Rexroad, this is a To-do List built in VS Code. This website allows the user to organize a list of things to-do.

Functionality offered

All pages have a menu bar located at the top of the screen that will take the user to the Todo-List page, or to the Contact page. The Todo-List page allows the user to type in whatever they need to do, and submit it to become part of the list. Once something is added to the list it can either be edited or deleted. Allowing for mistakes and for taking things off after they are completed. 

Technologies Used

HTML CSS JavaScript React

Future improvement

I would like to add a Home Page. 
I would like to add more design to the pages. 
I would like to add a completed button.
